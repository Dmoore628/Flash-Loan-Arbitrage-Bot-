# Glossary

## Overview

This glossary provides definitions for key terms, concepts, and acronyms used throughout the Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot Simulator project. Understanding these terms will help you better navigate the documentation and codebase.

## Arbitrage Terms

### Arbitrage
The practice of taking advantage of price differences for the same asset across different markets, earning profit from the price discrepancy without any market risk.

### Spatial Arbitrage
A type of arbitrage where the same token pair (e.g., WETH/USDC) is traded across different exchanges to profit from price differences. Also called "cross-exchange arbitrage."

### Triangular Arbitrage
A strategy that exploits price inefficiencies across three different tokens in a circular trade sequence (e.g., WETH → USDC → DAI → WETH), profiting from rate discrepancies.

### Flash Loan
An uncollateralized loan that must be borrowed and repaid within the same blockchain transaction. If the loan cannot be repaid within the transaction, the entire transaction reverts.

### Flash Loan Arbitrage
Using flash loans to execute arbitrage strategies without requiring upfront capital, borrowing the needed funds and repaying them within the same transaction.

## DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Terms

### DEX (Decentralized Exchange)
A peer-to-peer marketplace where users can trade cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries or centralized control.

### AMM (Automated Market Maker)
A type of DEX that uses mathematical formulas and liquidity pools instead of traditional order books to price assets and execute trades.

### Liquidity Pool
A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate decentralized trading by providing liquidity for token swaps.

### Slippage
The difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual executed price, typically caused by market movement or low liquidity.

### TVL (Total Value Locked)
The total amount of cryptocurrency locked in a DeFi protocol or liquidity pool, representing the platform's liquidity and adoption.

### Yield Farming
The practice of lending or staking cryptocurrency tokens to earn rewards, often in the form of additional tokens.

## Blockchain and Ethereum Terms

### Smart Contract
Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, running on blockchain networks like Ethereum.

### Gas Fee
The cost required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain, paid in ETH.

### Gas Limit
The maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction.

### Gas Price
The amount a user is willing to pay per unit of gas, typically measured in Gwei (1 ETH = 1 billion Gwei).

### Gwei
A denomination of Ethereum's cryptocurrency Ether (ETH). 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH.

### Block
A collection of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain approximately every 12-15 seconds on Ethereum.

### Mempool
The set of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in the next block.

### Nonce
A number used only once in a cryptographic communication, often used in blockchain transactions to prevent replay attacks.

## Trading and Finance Terms

### Profit and Loss (P&L)
The calculation of gains or losses from trading activities over a specific period.

### Net Profit
The final profit after deducting all costs including gas fees, trading fees, and flash loan fees.

### Gross Profit
The profit before deducting any fees or costs.

### ROI (Return on Investment)
A performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment, calculated as (Gain - Cost) / Cost.

### Volatility
A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, indicating how much the price moves up and down.

### Market Cap
The total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total supply of tokens.

### Spread
The difference between the bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices of an asset.

### Order Book
A list of buy and sell orders for a specific asset, organized by price level.

## MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) Terms

### MEV
The maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions.

### Front-running
The practice of seeing a pending transaction and then submitting a similar transaction with a higher gas fee to be executed first.

### Sandwich Attack
A form of MEV where an attacker places transactions before and after a target transaction to profit from the price movement caused by the target transaction.

### Flashbots
A platform that enables private transaction pools and auction mechanisms for MEV extraction, helping to make MEV extraction more fair and transparent.

## Technical Terms

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications, specifying how software components should interact.

### React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications with dynamic content.

### TypeScript
A programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.

### Vite
A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

### Webhook
A method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write.

### REST API
A set of web service standards that use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources.

## Protocol-Specific Terms

### AAVE
A decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies, including flash loans.

### Uniswap
A decentralized exchange protocol built on Ethereum that uses an automated market maker model.

### SushiSwap
A community-driven decentralized exchange forked from Uniswap, offering additional features like yield farming.

### Curve Finance
A decentralized exchange optimized for stablecoin trading with low slippage and fees.

### Balancer
An automated portfolio manager and decentralized exchange that allows for multi-token pools with different weights.

### Compound
A decentralized lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency.

## Mathematical and Algorithm Terms

### Constant Product Formula
The mathematical formula used by AMMs like Uniswap: x × y = k, where x and y are token reserves and k is a constant.

### Price Impact
The effect that a trade has on the price of an asset, typically larger for bigger trades or in less liquid markets.

### Arbitrage Opportunity
A situation where the same asset is priced differently across markets, creating a risk-free profit opportunity.

### Kelly Criterion
A mathematical formula for determining the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize wealth growth.

### Sharpe Ratio
A measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as (return - risk-free rate) / standard deviation of return.

## Risk Management Terms

### Stop Loss
An order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price, used to limit losses.

### Position Sizing
The process of determining how much capital to allocate to a particular trade or investment.

### Drawdown
The peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment or trading strategy.

### Value at Risk (VaR)
A statistic that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame.

### Risk-Free Rate
The theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk, often represented by government bond yields.

## Simulation and Testing Terms
